[1. Detail Test Steps:]
- Deploy all stacks on NCIR using heat templates provided to package.
- Using defaulf commisioning file from O&M ( SBTS5G18A_5g_pid11_abik_1cell.xml ) do a gNB commisioning.
- Wait untill DU sw is updated
- Try ssh from OAM to DU

[2. Expected Result:]
is possible to get to DU via fronthaul iterface by ssh

[3. Actual Result:]
it is not possible to get to DU from CPIF, UPUE, OAM using ssh
