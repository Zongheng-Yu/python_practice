Timeout occurs after 5 seconds in RROM for cell delete and RROM sends new cell delete. Same happens with that procedure also. Then RROM sends MAC_CellSetupReq to L2, but L2 discards it. because there is already ongoing cell delete procedure for the same cellId. I am now preparing a cellVm lib where debug prints have been added to see if PS_StopSchedulingCellResp is received by L2 or not. Tester said that the timeout issues didn't occur anymore with newer build #348.  We agreed that tester will try to run 5-10 times the same test scenario by using Cell Vm lib where extra prints added. If issue not reproduced anymore then pronto will be closed as FNR.

Fault subcategory: LTE Control Plane Alarms
Fault ID and name: 6292: EFaultId_ResourcePoolConfigurationFailedAl
System components: BTS SC: BTSOM SW

Reporting method to O&M                  
1. C-plane SW reports fault in LOM_FaultInd to LOM.
2. LOM forwards fault notification in Fault_Req_Msg to NodeOAM
