From Bm, Bharath (Nokia - IN/Bangalore) bharath.bm@nokia.com:
Just to add on top of Chethan’s analysis, the VMs which are not responding are OAM VM and CCP VM. Do we really have GTP path supervision running on these two VMs ? If so is it required to have the same since both OAM and Control plane would not have any user plane events (GTP events )being exchanged. If these do not have GTP supervision then we definitely will have the alarm raised from RAP since the GTP echo requests are not responded by these VMs. 
We now need to check from OAM as to why do we have IWF entries being added for these two VMs where we might not have user plane events being exchanged and hence would not require to have GTP path supervision for the same.
Excerpts from ICOM lookup table and the trs tpl events which adds IWF entries for these two VMs :
VM DEVICE ID = 57408, VM UDP PORT = 52152, PEER IP = 10.107.54.14
VM DEVICE ID = 57424, VM UDP PORT = 52152, PEER IP = 10.107.54.30

[1. Detail Test Steps:]
-SW upgrade from 4.31012.145 to 4.31012.146
Apply following WA:
	Before SCF commisioninig:
	On CPIF VM modify file /opt/nokia/SS_CPLANE/etc/enb_conf.ini
Modify parameter: f1apAddress=CPIF VM fronthaul IP
After commisioning:
	put cprt_config.xml to ASIK: /ffs/run with following content:
sctpconfig
  sctpserverCPIF VM fronthaul IP/sctpserver
  sctpserverport38472/sctpserverport
  sctpclient192.168.2.61/sctpclient
  sctpclientport38472/sctpclientport
/sctpconfig
-	Reset site.

2018-06-22 SG: Correction knife for PR353147 (= just a revert) tested based on 5G18A_4.2113.66 + Knife tested successfully : Cell reach OnAir. No L2 PS crash. Now  Correction knife for PR353147 (= just a revert)  version for R1L1 master branch is under test to see if also there no L2 PS crash happens.
Next Step after R1 test:  Attach the issue to PR353147.
2018-06-20 SG / evening: SWconfig file needed to exclude configuration issue. Retest required when PR353147 (QT regression broken)  is solved also on Master.
2018-06-20 SG: SW.config needs to be checked. Waiting to get this file; Luca C. will check this then.
Also L2-PS resource allocation is under clarification, who will be assigned to check the crash.","Wang, Yifeng 1.
