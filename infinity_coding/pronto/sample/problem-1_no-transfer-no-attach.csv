2. Test Case name:
PM collect
3. Used Flags:
NA
4. Detail Test Steps:
1). Set nrLimitIntraFreq and nrLimitInterFreq with special value 0 successfully as NIDD.
5. Expected Result:
The prompt information in VNF WebUI show the special value 0. 
6. Actual Result:
The prompt information in VNF WebUI hasn't shown the special value 0 and isn't in the range. It's hard to understand in user side. 
7. Fault Occurrence Rate:
permanent
8. Change since Last Success:
NA
9. Known Condition:
NA
10. Log(s) file name containing a fault:
NA

11. Customer impact analysis.
In simply, in NIDD, there is special value like “0”, but in VNF WebUI, it just show the normal range. It’s hard to understand in user side. 
NetAct has defined them as special, why VNF WebUI won’t that still will be used to user. 

- Workaround and recovery: NA
12. Tester analysis:

PR349690,"[ABIL X21] CPRI: Sync issues, LCV and Test Payload errors","[1. Detail Test Steps:]
Setup of all CPRI subsystems according to CPRICORE_001 documentation and then polling for sync status, LCV and Test Payload errors.

[2. Expected Result:]
All CPRI links achieve HFNSYNC state, no LCV errors, no Test Payload errors, CRX FIFO is stable.

[3. Actual Result:]
Not all of CPRI links are able to achieve HFNSYNC, and some of those that did, reports LCV and Test Payload errors.

[4. Tester analysis:]

[5. Log(s) file name containing a fault: (clear indication (exact file name) and timestamp where fault can be found in attached logs)]
WRO_abil_cpri_2018-06-05-15-25-29-854 - Contains log of the test case execution on setup 1 (setup described below)
VLX_abil_cpri_2018-06-05-15-24-35-098 - Contains log of the test case execution on setup 2 (setup described below)

[6. Test-Line Reference/used HW/configuration/tools/SW version]
Setup 1:
Asik X22 + 3x Abil X21, MB_PS_REL_2018_04_007, Loner: PL0.3.
QSFPs used:
Slot 1: two FTL410QD4C twice
Slot 2:  FTL410QD3C and FTL410QD4C
Slot 3: two FTL410QD3C

Setup 2:
Asik X31 + 3x Abil X21, MB_PS_LFS_OS_2018_04_0080, Loner: PL0.3.
QSFPs used:
Slot 1: two RTXM320-450-C39 twice
Slot 2:  RTXM320-450-C39 and FTL4C1QL1C-NN
Slot 3: two RTXM320-450-C39


[7. Used Flags: (list here used R&D flags)]
NA

[8. Fault Occurrence Rate:]
Permament, but not always the same links reports errors. It varies between runs of the test case and between setups.

[9. Test Scenario History of Execution: (what was changed since it was tested successfully for the last time)]
   Was Test Scenario passing before?
It was passing when run on previous releases of Loner images ( regular ones, not the PowerLoad ). It never worked when run on the image that supports both QSFPs.
   What was the last SW version Test Scenario was passing?
W17
   Were there any differences between test-lines since last time Test Scenario was passing?
Yes, but not relevant
   Were there any changes in Test Scenario since last run it passed?
No

[1. Detail Test Steps:]
we activated 425 H feature wuth ASIA/ABIK HW on gNB and AP. We started the attach command on AP egate and on BB2 of gNB. We than expect attach complete message on ePCSIM finally.

[2. Expected Result:] Attach complete

[3. Actual Result:] Attach scenario is not successfull. RRC Connection complete message is sent from AP L3 to AP L2. But this meaasge is not inclided in any ULDataUe_PuschPayloadTbSendReq. Instead of the message there are just paddings successfully transmitted to the gNB side. So no issue of missing grants...
