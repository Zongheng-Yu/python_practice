2018-08-10 [J.Pacheco]: Brian's fix needs an additional correction which was provided Sanna Tikkanen 
2018-08-08 [J.Pacheco]: Aleksey Valov and Jani Arhipoff's conclusion after deeper analysis is that this issue should be fixed by correction done by Brian Cort for PR348289.
2018-07-27 [Korpok P] New info from Aleksey: ""PR350064 - is different then L1 case, so that fix will not help. I have the analysis, just need a bit more time to give final conclusion on that as I still do not think the problem is in LFS C&S. I'll updated today""
2018-07-26 [S Renaud] Still under checking between Aleksey V and L1 team.
2018-07-25 [Korpok P] Still under checking by AlekseyV. There is probability that this will be case for L1. To be confirmed by Aleksey.
2018-07-23 [Korpok P] AlekseyV investigating. He will check further about the possible knife of this change or if it can be done manually to test (that is just changing the script that is called upon boot). He will update again tomorrow.
2018-07-20 [Korpok P] AlekseyV will be back in this case on Monday. 
2018-07-20 [Korpok P] Most probably related C&S commits not present in IB5G2 branch. Not possible to retest with MB as no 5G builds which are using MB PS.
2018-07-19 [Korpok P] Asked PR author to retest with newest available PS build: 
 IB5G2_PS_REL_2018_05_031   or   MB_PS_REL_2018_07_010  if using mainbranch. Waiting for results.
2018-07-18 Jacek Wojcik: Main issue with BCN is caused by missing LFS implementation for ABIL. PR moved back to LFS. Retest with newer version of LFS is needed.
2018-07-18 Souleymane transfer to BBB because  SfpS are not handled by mcu opperability team.
2018-07-18 Maxim Plekh: lfs_analysis_2.txt on BCN issue atached.
Regarding lfs_analysis_1.txt SfpS owner Raimo Korva told that ""handleUnitStateChange is needed only in FSMF"", SfpS specification does not document AUTODET_UNIT_IND_MSG handling, Adet specification is not clear why API3_AUTODET_UNIT_IND_MSG is used instead of API_AUTODET_UNIT_IND_MSG (which is supported by SfpS)

2018-07-18 Asked for additional recurses for 5g Operability 
2018-07-17 Maxim Plekh: Investigating, need comments from MCUHWAPI on 
lfs_analysis_1.txt attached, if this is relevant, then need review on proposal https://gerrit.ext.net.nokia.com/gerrit/#/c/400684/
2018-07-16 [Korpok P] To be continued by Plekh, Maxim (EXT - FI/Oulu) as AlekseyV involved in customer case.
2018-07-13 [Korpok P] Infor from AlekseyV: ""Still checking. Hopefully will have something early on next week.""
2018-07-12 [Korpok P] Investigation ongoing but a little bit delayed due to AlekseyV involvement to other blocker case.
2018-07-11 [Korpok P] Logs from the retest provided. AlekseyV asked by Stephane for expertise from his side.
2018-07-09 : Retest will be started soon
2018-07-06 A Ramusga new logs available
2018-07-05 A Ramusga IR raised to ask for retest with newer soft which contains the BCN fixes. 
2018-07-03 [J. Arhipoff]: LFS C&S analysis added.
2018-07-02 [J. Arhipoff]: Checking logs and trying to reproduce the issue in our own setup.
2018-06-26/27 [J.Pacheco]: 1)LFS expert/Stephane Renaud check snapshot and he saw many crash dump from CCSRT. DSPHWAPI is involvded in mail thread to check. 2) Author replaced ASIK x22 onto ASIK x23 and there is no problem with 16 synchro error.

*** END OF DEFAULT TEMPLATE ***",03.08.2018,NIULSLFS,5GC000631-B,Closed,A - Critical,< empty >,5GBTS_18A,"[#RC: known: 2018-08-10, LE: 2018-08-10]
2018-08-10 [J.Pacheco]: Aleksey Valov and Jani Arhipoff's analysis is that this issue is same as 
PR350064/PR365054  and it is corrected by fix delivered today by Sanna Tikkanen (on top of Brian Cort's fix).
2018-08-10 [J. Arhipoff]: No need to collect additional linux logs (at least for now). One possible root cause found and analysis ongoing (Aleksey is continuing the work with this pronto)
2018-08-09 [J. Arhipoff]: LFS C&S analysis added.
2018-08-09 [J.Pacheco]: Oam is checking last modifications in oam component as a possible cause of the issue, but seems at this point that there is no link. In parallel Aleksey Valov and Jani Arhipoff , C&S expert resumed Sanna's investigation and they are suspecting issue to be caused by wrong SW BCN calculation: seems that MCU HWAPI is not synchronizing after changing the BCN. Jani will provide detailed analysis this morning and AP will be defined.
2018-08-08 ECE Code RED: 3 PR corrections done by ECE between working and non-working load, should not be any impact to the functionality (related to IPV6). OAM logs from succesfull and non succesfull case were requested yesterday. Reminder to Pronto author sent. 
2018-08-08 [J.Pacheco]: C&S expert compared the logs from successful case 4.33111.180 and from NOK case and on the latter the ""16 unit  synchronization failed"" alarm is generated for 0x123A but in successful case this node was never added to node list. It is possible that the alarm would occur also in successful case if 0x123A node was added to node list. OAM check is requested to know if there were any changes done to unit detection or added new nodes for synchronization.
2018-08-06/07 [J.Pacheco]: No change in PS_REL between load working and the one with issue, but oam version changed. A new knife build taking 4.33111.182 as baseline with reverted node oam version 4.3.77 but result is NOK (shoudl work)!
06.08.2018 - might be similar case to PR350064. According to QT team problem started to be visible on the build where the only changed componet was OAM. Knife to revert changes under preparation and it's goint go be testeed by QT team stuill today.
2018-08-06 EMarchand: seems similiar to PR350064, to be confirmed  by Aleksey Valov
2018-08-03 RR: Pre-investigation started.
ABIL PS should continue this pronto investigation.
OAM point of view node polling failed for 0x123A and OAM raise alarm 16 from this case.
